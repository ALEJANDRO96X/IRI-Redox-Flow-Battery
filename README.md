# IRI Redox Flow Battery
Redox flow battery project within the doctoral thesis developed at the Institute of Robotics and Informatics (IRI) [IRI Project](https://sites.google.com/view/flowbat2021iri/pti-flowbat-iri?authuser=0).

This page has been created to give visibility to the work developed in the IRI in terms of modeling and control of a redox flow batteries. Here is presented the model that is being developed in Matlab and that allows us to analyze the operation of a redox flow battery.

# What contains this project
This project presents the folders that are contained in this project, and how to use the different files in case that anyone wants to simulate his particular redox flow battery system, or determine some of the parameters that can not been easily measured, with real data by means of a calibration algorithm that is presented.

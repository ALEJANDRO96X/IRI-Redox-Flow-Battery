## Redox Flow Battery

A redox flow battery is an electrochemical cell where chemical energy is provided by two chemical components dissolved in liquids that are pumped through the system on separate sides of a membrane. Ion exchange occurs through the membrane while both liquids circulate in their own respective space.

More information about what a redox flow battery is, and the work carried out in the IRI can be found in the following webpage [IRI Work](https://sites.google.com/view/flowbat2021iri/pti-flowbat-iri?authuser=0)

### Model of a Redox Flow Battery

Here is presented the model that we have develop in MATLAB in order to analyze and validate the behaviour of a redox flow batteries system. 

```markdown
The model is divided in the following parts:

# Electrochemical model
# Thermal model
# Hydarulic model

- Bulleted
- List
